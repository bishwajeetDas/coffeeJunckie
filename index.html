      House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and
      every drinker. That is what makes them so unique and so special. The
      blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the
      roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House
      Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
      one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters
      work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup of coffee,
      period.” Brewing coffee is also an important factor in how the flavors and
      aromas are represented in the cup. Preference depends on the consumer of
      the final cup, but there are clear benefits to different brewing styles.

      Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans. The coffee
      plant thrives under the shade of banana trees in a tropical climate. The
      way the beans grow, is shaped by Colombia’s high altitude. The country
      produces plenty of coffee and exports a lot of its best beans. You could
      get your hands on Colombian single-origin coffee and start brewing! Before
      that, let's tell you why it's so special. The unique flavors and strong
      aroma makes Colombian coffee a favorite for many. Coffee culture is unique
      across the number of countries that love it. When we talk about Colombian
      coffee, we are not talking about a roasting or brewing method but how it
      is grown. Colombia is a near-perfect coffee-growing climate. That is, it
      produces a specific type of bean from the environment. Colombia
      experiences heavy rainfall and the landscape never gets close to falling
      below freezing temperatures at any time of the year. The richness of the
      flavor of Colombian beans comes from the perfect climate, good soil, and
      the right amount of rainfall. Coffee grows well in places with at least
      200 centimeters of rainfall each year.
